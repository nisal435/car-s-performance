explanation of above code:

Plot 'a':
Data: x-axis represents 'Year_from', y-axis represents 'city_fuel_per_100km_l'.
Geometries: Points (in steel blue) for data points and a linear regression line (in red).
Labels: Plot title is "City fuel per 100 km," x-axis label is "Time," and y-axis has no label.

Plot 'b':
Data: x-axis represents 'Year_from', y-axis represents 'highway_fuel_per_100km_l'.
Geometries: Points (in steel blue) for data points and a linear regression line (in red).
Labels: Plot title is "Highway fuel per 100 km," x-axis label is "Time," and y-axis has no label.

Plot 'c':
Data: x-axis represents 'Year_from', y-axis represents 'CO2_emissions_g/km'.
Geometries: Points (in steel blue) for data points and a linear regression line (in red).
Labels: Plot title is "CO2 emission per km," x-axis label is "Time," and y-axis has no label.
The grid.arrange(a, b, c) function arranges these three plots into a grid for easy comparison and visualization.
